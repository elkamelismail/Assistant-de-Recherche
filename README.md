# Assistant-de-Recherche


I have developed an assistant in Python that seamlessly handles user input in the form of text or audio. If the input is in audio format, I intelligently convert it into text. Based on the user's input, the assistant efficiently search for relevant images, videos, and articles, providing a comprehensive range of results. This assistant streamlines the search process, saving users valuable time and effort.
